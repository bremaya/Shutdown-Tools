# Shutdown Tools

A collection of tools for shutdown, reboot, suspend, hibernate, logout, lock and screen off the system. Only unpack and enjoy (unpack in PortableApps folder to integrate with him).

Uses a .exe (.bat converted) with arguments for NirCmd (https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html) to excute the actions, only ScrrenOff command is not NirCmd and use ScrrenOff application (https://www.thewindowsclub.com/screenoff-turn-off-windows-laptop-screen).

This project is just a hobby and I'm not affiliated, nor connected to any of the developers of the software used. I'm not related with NirSoft (https://www.nirsoft.net) or PortableApps ((https://portableapps.com).

This is packed with NirCmd v2.86 and ScreenOff v2.1.
