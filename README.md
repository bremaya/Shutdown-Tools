# Shutdown Tools

A collection of tools for shutdown, reboot, suspend, hibernate, logout, lock and screen off the system. Only unpack and enjoy (unpack in PortableApps folder to integrate with him).

Uses a .exe (.bat converted) with arguments for NirCmd (https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html) to excute the actions, only ScrrenOff command is not NirCmd and use ScrrenOff application (https://www.thewindowsclub.com/screenoff-turn-off-windows-laptop-screen).

This project is just a hobby and I'm not affiliated, nor connected to any of the developers of the software used. I'm not related with NirSoft (https://www.nirsoft.net) or PortableApps ((https://portableapps.com).

This is packed with NirCmd v2.86 and ScreenOff v2.1.
Any problems mail to > bremaya@gmail.com

Description of the softwares I used:

NirCmd (https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html)

NirCmd is a small command-line utility that allows you to do some useful tasks without displaying any user interface. By running NirCmd with simple command-line option, you can write and delete values and keys in the Registry, write values into INI file, dial to your internet account or connect to a VPN network, restart windows or shut down the computer, create shortcut to a file, change the created/modified date of a file, change your display settings, turn off your monitor, open the door of your CD-ROM drive, and more...

ScreenOff (https://www.thewindowsclub.com/screenoff-turn-off-windows-laptop-screen)

ScreenOff is a first-of-its-kind 13KB freeware that lets you turn off your Windows laptop monitor screen in a click, without putting it to Sleep. This tool does not use a batch command. It uses a SendMessage Visual Basic command to send the system, the command to turn off the display. Moreover, it is a portable tool that does not require to be installed. Nor does it ask you to download and install any specific .NET Framework version.
